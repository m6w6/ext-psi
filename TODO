* avoid allocs inside structures by reallocating the whole structure
* let the various list types be hashtables where appropriate
* check out jit-dynamic
* fix arginfo with nullable types
* pemalloc
* think about a better system for EXTVARs, separate \set and \get functions are clunky
* impl_def_val: allow num_exp
* fix right recursion of let_exp and set_exp
* improve varargs support, currently it's impossible to map e.g. curl_easy_setopt
* cpp: asm aliasing/redirects
* impl_var.name: remove leading '$'
