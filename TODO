* avoid allocs inside structures by reallocating the whole structure
* let the various list types be hashtables where appropriate
* check out jit-dynamic
* fix arginfo with nullable types
* think about a better system for EXTVARs, separate \set and \get functions are clunky
* fix right recursion of let_exp and set_exp
* improve varargs support, currently it's impossible to map e.g. curl_easy_setopt
* impl_var.name: remove leading '$'
* really solve the array/pointer problem

* variadic macros
* predefined macros
  ...
* builtins
  ...
* int128
* very small real numbers
* cache tokens of files and copy tokens if used for further processing

* optimized inlines like htonl
* real integral type of enums

* #pragma PSI lib "foo" instead of lib "foo";
* #line directive
